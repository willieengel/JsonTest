    "summary": "I am an impact-driven entrepreneur and network intelligence executive with a people-first philosophy. I have combined my professional leadership in the innovation economy with an academic foundation in international human rights to work as a cross-functional founder and people leader in the tech startup ecosystem. I think outside the box, cut the red tape, revel in collaboration, and carry a fresh perspective on how to amplify the impact of human-centric experiences to drive business outcomes. \n\nIn the past 10 years, I have purposely sought out work in the critical corners of the Canadian tech ecosystem — as a founder, a team member, a board member, and an investor. I've helped to build a world-renowned accelerator, co-founded Canada's largest tech meetup group, operated within early-stage startups, worked in venture capital, and founded my own national organization. Now, I am an operating partner at a VC firm that invests in founders who are building category-defining businesses in often overlooked cities across the continent. \n\nThe common thread for me has always been to help people find one another. I believe that great people, together, build incredible things. I also believe that Canada is one of the best places in the world to build a business and, frankly, just be human.",
